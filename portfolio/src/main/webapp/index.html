      <h1>James Washington's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio. It'll include a lot of things about me.
         I'm born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri (I'm really from
         a small town called Grandview, but it's close enough!). I have
         3 siblings, of which I'm the oldest son. I have over 40 cousins,
         so family gatherings are always a ton of fun! Education is big in
         my family, so college is always pushed. I'm a rising junior and I
         attend Morehouse College. I study Computer Science, and I plan on
         going into industry when I graduate.
