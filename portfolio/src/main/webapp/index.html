          <td> This is my portfolio. It'll include a lot of things about me.
               I'm born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri (I'm really from
         	   a small town called Grandview, but it's close enough!). I have
         	   3 siblings, of which I'm the oldest son. I have over 40 cousins,
         	   so family gatherings are always a ton of fun! Education is big in
         	   my family, so college is always pushed. I'm a rising junior and I
         	   attend Morehouse College. I study Computer Science, and I plan on
         	   going into industry when I graduate. I interned at Google Summer 2019,
         	   and I'm interning Summer 2020 as well. Outside of these I don't have very
         	   many projects.</td>
